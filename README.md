# Project Title: AI-Powered FIR Analysis for Accurate Legal Section Application

## Introduction

This project aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze First Information Reports (FIRs). The primary goal is to assist law enforcement personnel in accurately identifying and applying the appropriate legal acts and sections corresponding to the incidents described in an FIR. This tool helps streamline the process of FIR analysis, reduces human error, and ensures consistency in legal interpretations.

## Key Features

- **Automated FIR Analysis:** Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the content of FIRs.
- **Act and Section Prediction:** Employs ML models to predict relevant legal acts and sections based on the FIR text.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive interface for uploading FIRs and viewing analysis results.
- **Accuracy and Consistency:** Aims to improve the accuracy and consistency of applying legal sections.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle a large volume of FIRs.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd src/frontend
    npm install  # or yarn install
    cd ../..
    ```
3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd src/backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming Python backend
    cd ../..
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the `src/backend` directory.
    - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys). Refer to `.env.example` if available.
5.  **Download/Prepare Data:**
    - Place the necessary FIR datasets in the `data/raw/` directory.
    - Run data preprocessing scripts if required:
      ```bash
      python src/ml/preprocess_data.py # Example script
      ```
6.  **Train ML Model (Optional - if pre-trained models are not provided):**
    ```bash
    python src/ml/train_model.py # Example script
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd src/backend
    python app.py # or your specific command to start the backend server
    cd ../..
    ```
2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    cd src/frontend
    npm start # or yarn start
    cd ../..
    ```
3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured frontend port).

## How to Use

1.  **Upload FIR:** Navigate to the upload section of the application.
2.  **Submit for Analysis:** Upload the FIR document (e.g., text file, PDF).
3.  **View Results:** The application will process the FIR and display the predicted legal acts and sections along with confidence scores or explanations.
